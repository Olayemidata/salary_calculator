# salary_calculator
I created this application to help job seekers, employees, and HR professionals/employers calculate the salary expectation for a role based on the candidate's skills and work experience. The estimated salary is calculated using the country's minimum wage, the skills of the job seeker, and relevant work experience. The app is seamless and easy to use.
