# salary_calculator
I created this application to help job seekers or employees calculate their salary expectation for a role based on their skills and work experience. The salary expectation is calculated using the minimum wage, the work experience and the skills of the job seeker. Organisations and HR professionals can also use this to calculate the estimated salary for a role.
